<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">We are experiencing one of the most exciting times in history as we now have the opportunity to <b>create a different society</b>. This society will be based on the belief of <b>empowering the individuals</b> to open up an un-considered, un-used and un-valued potential in people and communities.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">Cryptoeconomics is one of these important <b>new research fields</b> which combines fundamental principles of game theory and cryptography for <b>managing in an autonomous way the interactions between people or machines</b> hence nodes in the decentralised world.</p>

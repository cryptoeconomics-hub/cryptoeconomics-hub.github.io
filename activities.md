			<h2>This is about knowledge</h2>
		</header>
		<p>One of the most valuable thing you will find in the crypto community is its <b>openness to sharing and explaining stuff</b> to people. This hub will be no different. It will share the same values, only that it will focus on cryptoeconomics.</p>
		<p>We believe cryptoeconomics is what really matters in the crypto space and the only field of research worth researching to make significant progress. We want to build <b>an international community from all genders, backgrounds and interests</b> that wants to partake in making history.</p>

					<h3>Meetups</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Cryptoeconomics.hub was born as a Meetup. It has now more than <b>500 members</b> and is located in Madrid, Spain. The mission of Cryptoeconomics.hub is to share knowledge and as so, Meetups are a great way to spread it.</p>
				<p>Our Meetups are an opportunity to <b>meet with new people whose work is related with cryptoeconomics</b>, although sometimes it takes some time to realise that it does.</p>
				<p>If yourself or somebody you know would like to present new insights about cryptoeconomics in one of our Meetups, please <a href="#contact" class="scrolly" alt="">get in touch</a>. Note that we don't do ICO promotions.</p>

					<h3>Training</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Everything we have learned so far allowed us to build an understanding of how the blockchain works. We believe that <b>learning the fundamentals is the only way to make progress in this space</b>.</p>
				<p>We are currently offering a <b><a href="training.html" alt="">training program</a></b> about the fundamentals of blockchain and cryptoeconomics in particular. We group our lectures in modules but we can also accommodate your specific needs.</p>
				<p>If you are interested in being part of this education program don't hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="scrolly" alt="">get in touch</a>.</p>
